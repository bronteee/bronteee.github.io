I wake up in a cabin or a house in the countryside or in the forest or on the beach.

There are birds singing all around me.

I do my usual exercise or yoga but am content with wherever I am on my performance.

I make coffee and enjoy every little sound it makes and the foam floating on top of the cup.

The world is quiet and at peace, and beautiful.

I am compelled to do something creative, perhaps it’s painting or pottery. I make something beautiful, to me.

Then I go explore, perhaps somewhere I have been before. But I discover new things that I hadn’t noticed. A new shell on the beach, a pretty rock that ended up there after a journey of millions of years.

I feel small, in a comforting way. Like a piece of sand in the vast ocean. An atom, unaware of the complexities beyond its minuscule reach.

Simply exist.

It may not seem like it at times, but all those things are within you.

A shelter.

A romantic in a world of practicality.

A treasure to be discovered at the top of the climb but it was always just in your pocket.

A soreness in the back of the throat at the realization of what truly matters.

Letting go.

Except life is like a swing.

So then let us savor the brief moments of lightness.

Sweet memories with bitterness because of its irreproducibility.

Like stones on a beach and trees in a forest.

We carry markings of our uniqueness.

Living is the way of expression.

So, go exist.
