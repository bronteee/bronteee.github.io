title: Wildfire Spread Modeling
layout: page
---

We leverage deep learning and explainable AI to model short-term wildfire spread from satellite data and improve current prediction accuracies. Through this project we hope to achieve the following goals:

*Compile public datasets with wildfire spread data*

*Apply explainable AI and deep learning techniques to model short-term wildfire spread and improve current prediction accuracies*

*Deploy open source tooling and dashboards to visualize results and predict ongoing fires*
