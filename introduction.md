The threat of catastrophic wildfires has grown in recent years due to climate change and land management practices. This project aims to improve wildfire spread prediction and model impact on marginalized communities after fires using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and deep learning techniques to provide actionable insights on wildfire prevention and management both short term and long term. 

The first objective is to compile publicly available datasets containing information on past wildfires, vegetation types, and environmental conditions. These datasets will be cleaned, processed, and combined to create a comprehensive dataset for training AI models.

Explainable AI and deep neural network methodologies will then be applied to model short-term (next day) wildfire spread and improve on current predictive capabilities. The explainability techniques will provide insight into the key factors driving the AI predictions. Additionally, these techniques will be applied to better understand and minimize the impacts of wildfires on vulnerable populations.

Finally, open source tools will be developed to visualize the AI model explanations and predictions. This will enable fire managers and researchers to interactively explore results and gain a deeper understanding of wildfire impacts.

The project deliverables will include cleaned datasets, trained AI models, open source visualization tools, and documentation. All components will be publicly released to support improved wildfire modeling, prediction, and mitigation worldwide.
