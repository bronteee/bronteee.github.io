      <div class="entry">
        <p>Now that we have our dataset ready, it is time to obtain some baseline results with the goal of 1/ evaluate the difficulty of the problem and 2/ determine if the problem is framed correctly. With that in mind, we will be using the Unet architecture as the starting architecture for this segmentation task.</p>
