## About Bronte

Bronte found her passion in artificial intelligence and research while working as a senior medical laboratory scientist at Seattle Children's and then at a digital health AI startup. She helped develop and perform high complexity diagnostic testing, including one of the first COVID-19 PCR tests in Seattle. This experience sparked her interest in using AI to improve healthcare technology and make it more accessible. Now Bronte is excited to pursue interdisciplinary AI research that can benefit underserved populations. She brings a unique perspective with her background spanning AI, medicine, and public health. In her free time, Bronte enjoys traveling, doing CrossFit with friends, and yoga. Her interdisciplinary knowledge helps inform creative solutions at the intersection of AI and healthcare.

## About This Project

The threat of catastrophic wildfires has grown in recent years due to climate change and land management practices. This project aims to improve wildfire spread prediction and models of vegetation recovery after fires using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and deep learning techniques to provide actionable insights on wildfire prevention and management both short term and long term. 

The first objective is to compile publicly available datasets containing information on past wildfires, vegetation types, and environmental conditions. These datasets will be cleaned, processed, and combined to create a comprehensive dataset for training AI models.

Explainable AI and deep neural network methodologies will then be applied to model short-term (next day) wildfire spread and improve on current predictive capabilities. The explainability techniques will provide insight into the key factors driving the AI predictions. Longer-term vegetation recovery will also be modeled to predict the timeline and nature of regrowth based on fire severity, vegetation type, climate, and other variables. 

Finally, open source tools will be developed to visualize the AI model explanations and predictions. This will enable fire managers and researchers to interactively explore results and gain a deeper understanding of wildfire impacts.

The project deliverables will include cleaned datasets, trained AI models, open source visualization tools, and documentation. All components will be publicly released to support improved wildfire modeling, prediction, and mitigation worldwide.
